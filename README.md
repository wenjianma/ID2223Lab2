## Description
This lab is about Text Transcription using Transformers to your Mother Tongue.  

### Task 1
In this task, we first fine-tune a pretrained  transformer model [Whisper provided by openai](https://openai.com/research/whisper) for mandarin.

Then, we build and run an inference pipeline with a [Gradio UI on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Dengty/Mandarin) for our model. 
In this Gradio UI, we realize the following functions.
1. Speak to Search.User can speak into the microphone about the video they want to search on Youtube.
2. Crawl Video. Then, the web crawler implemented by us will return a URL to the video.
3. Transcription. The audio of this video will be transcribed into text.

Overall, the 

### Task 2
In this task, we first explore how can we improve the model performance. We think in the following two approaches.
First approach is model-centric approach, which is about tuning hyperparamters, changing the fine-tuning model architecture.
Second approach is data-centric approach, which is about identifying new data sources enabling to train a better model.
#### Model-Centric Approach
(a) model-centric approach - e.g., tune hyperparameters, change the Ô¨Åne-tuning model architecture, etc



####  Data-Centric Approach
(b) data-centric approach - identify new data sources that enable you to train a better model that one provided in the blog post.
